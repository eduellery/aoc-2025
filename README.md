My answers for Advent of Code 2025.[^disclaimer]

## Introduction

### Language, Libraries and Frameworks

Language of choice: [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

* [Java 25 - History of Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)#Java_versions)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/)
* [JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/)

### History

This 2025 edition is a special, celebratory one: 10 years of AoC, 25 years since my first paid job, and Java turning 30. So it feels only fitting to use the language I’ve written the most in my life (Java) — which, coincidentally, has its latest LTS in a round-ish number, 25 (I’m fine with multiples of 5). From that version, I’ll try to incorporate as many features as possible.

[^disclaimer]: **Disclaimer**: I do AoC for fun and to learn new languages and new tricks. Part of my learning process (also for fun, even if I
already have experience with some language), is to check what other users do and learn things from them. I can't help but incorporate
their cool, clean, concise ideas into my code. Sometimes their code is *so* much better than mine that I end up replacing my whole code!
So I *do* come up with answers on my own, but I can't claim being the author of anything here - I'm not tracking what is mine and what I replaced. 🤷🏽‍
